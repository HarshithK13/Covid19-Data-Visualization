# Covid19-Data-Visualization
### Data Visualization Project
This project focuses on creating a Dashboard which shows the visualization of the countries and also shows the number Covid19 cases present in a specific province by clicking on it in the map between any specific interval of dates. 
It also contains plots showing the rise in the number of cumulative cases present. RShiny has been used as an interface for building this dashboard and Covid19 API has been used for the data.
